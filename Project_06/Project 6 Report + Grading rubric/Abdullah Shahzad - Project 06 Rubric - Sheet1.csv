CS152 Project 06 Rubric,,,,,,,,
"Grading: A project grade of 29 or 30 is a mark of honor, not given lightly. Recieving 1-3 extension points means that you earned 1-3 points on top of your core project. It does not mean that you lost 1 or more points. Celebrate your successes, and use the extension as an opportunity to explore a design challenge that interests you.",,,,,,,,
"Instructions for graders: To use this rubric, place an ""x"" in the appropriate column to indicate whether criteria are strongly satisfied, partially satisfied, or absent. Unmarked rows default to absent.",,,,,,,,
"Writeup Criteria
Writeups should be about 1 page long + images.",Strong,Developing,Emerging,Insufficient,Coeff,Max Pts Possible,Pts Earned,Comments
"Abstract defines this project's key lecture concepts for a general, non-CS audience. This week's key lecture topics are search and computational complexity. ",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Abstract summarizes program's context and output,in 1-2 sentences, highlighting a couple of important algorithmic and/or scientific details. What does your program do? What should the user expect to see when they run your program?",x,,,,1,0.5,0.5,
"Results are clearly presented in human-friendly images (e.g. graphs), labeled with captions, and concisely but clearly interpreted for a general audience (who have not taken this course) in the text. If your output includes numbers, explain for a general audience what these numbers mean!",x,,,,1,1.5,1.5,
Reflection (in a brief paragraph) draws connections between lecture concepts utilized in this project and real-world problems that interest you. How else could these concepts apply to our everyday lives? ,x,,,,1,0.75,0.75,

"File header at the top of every file includes your name, the date, a description of the file's purpose, with explicit example instructions on how to run the project from the Terminal. These should be in triple quotes at the top of the file.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Docstrings are present in every function. Each docstring describes the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value (if any). These should be directly below the function definition in triple quotes.",x,,,,1,2,2,
"Comments explain key design and implementation decisions, e.g. complex equations and blocks of code. For example, please label each version of your sum and average calculations.",x,,,,1,1,1,
Code organization: Code is organized into functions with no significant top-level code. The program's first algorithmic step is a call to the main() function.,x,,,,1,2,2,
"PROJECT 05:  elephant.py contains correct and efficient functions for simulating elephant populations and analyzing the impact of control strategies on the population: newElephant(), initPopulation(), incrementAge(), calcSurvival(), simulateMonth(), and simulateYear(), controlPopulation(), dartElephants(), cullElephants(), runSimulation(), and calcResults().",x,,,,1,3,3,
"TASKS 3-4:  Binary search. optimize() correctly and efficiently implements a binary search when given a reference to the ""cost"" function (usually elephant.elephantSim). It is verified with testESim(), which obtains reasonable results (close to 0.43) from a call to optimize(0, 0.5, elephant.elephantSim).",x,,,,1,4,4,
TASKS 5-7:  evalParameterEffect() streamlines analysis of how the simulation parameters influence the optimal population control strategy by modifying one parameter in a loop and calling optimize() such that the optimal percent darted is determined for each value of the parameter. Double check that the search bounds and tolerance are reasonable.,x,,,,1,4,4,
"TASK 8: Analysis (results). The writeup should include graphs (or tables) of the optimal percent darted for each required parameter range A-E (below). The axes of each graph/table should be labeled. 

    A. Vary the adult survival probability from 0.98 to 1.0 in steps of 0.001.
    B. Vary the calf survival probability from 0.80 to 0.90 in steps of 0.01.
    C. Vary the senior survival probability from 0.1 to 0.5 in steps of 0.05.
    D. Vary the calving interval from 3.0 to 3.4 in steps of 0.05.
    E. Vary the carrying capacity from 3500 to 7000 in steps of 500.

For full credit, the data must be interpreted for the reader in clear sentences within the writeup. What do these numbers mean? Why does the darting percentage go up/down when you vary each parameter? How should Kruger National Park use this information?",,x,,,0.75,4,3,Please give more analysis on the results
