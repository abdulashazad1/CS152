CS152 Project 06 Rubric,,,,,,,,
"Grading: A project grade of 29 or 30 is a mark of honor, not given lightly. Recieving 1-3 extension points means that you earned 1-3 points on top of your core project. It does not mean that you lost 1 or more points. Celebrate your successes, and use the extension as an opportunity to explore a design challenge that interests you.",,,,,,,,
"On the house: A few points are ""on the house,""  meaning that they are earned in full by every completed project. The score entry boxes for these points are grayed out in the rubric.",,,,,,,,
"Instructions for graders: To use this rubric, place an ""x"" in the appropriate column to indicate whether criteria are strongly satisfied, partially satisfied, or absent. Unmarked rows default to absent.",,,,,,,,

"Abstract defines this project's key lecture concepts for a general, non-CS audience. No new concept to define this week. Continue to bask in the warm glow of inheritance :)",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Abstract describes program's context and output, highlighting a couple of important algorithmic and/or scientific details. What does your program do? What should the user expect to see when they run your program?",x,,,,1,0.25,0.25,
"Solutions to tasks: Summarize key design and implementation decisions in your own words, focusing on part(s) of the project that most interested you and/or that required you to debug a tricky solution. This can often be done in 2-3 paragraphs if you're writing very clearly and to the point, but use your judgement.",x,,,,1,0.75,0.75,
"All included images/outputs are labeled with captions and explained in the text. For full credit, you must explain every output value and plot for the reader, including its units and what this value/plot says about the world!",x,,,,1,1,1,
Follow up questions are answered in your own words.,x,,,,1,0.5,0.5,
Reflection addresses how the lecture concepts from the abstract made this project achievable and how they apply to our everyday lives. For example: How many more lines of code this project would have taken without these tools? What other kinds of problems could you solve with these tools? Is there a connection between this project and a familiar tool you've used outside of class?,x,,,,1,0.5,0.5,
"Sources, imported libraries, and collaborators are cited, or a note is included indicating that none were referenced.",x,,,,1,1,1,

"File header at the top of every file includes your name, the date, a description of the file's purpose, and instructions for how to run the project from the Terminal.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Docstrings are present in every function. Each docstring describes the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value (if any).",x,,,,1,2,2,
"Comments explain key design and implementation decisions, e.g. complex equations and blocks of code. For example, what does your if-elif-else test for, and why? What does your loop iterate over, and why?",x,,,,1,1,1,
Code organization: Code is organized into functions with no significant top-level code. The program's first algorithmic step is a call to the main() function. Library functions are imported rather than rewritten in the main file.,x,,,,1,1,1,
"Variable and function names are brief but descriptive, helping others understand the purpose of each variable.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"LAB: RotatingLine class passes the test function. (Spins about its anchor point, which may be the middle of the line itself or anywhere else in the window.)",x,,,,1,2,2,
"TASK 1: RotatingBlock class behaves as expected (rotation, collisions, etc.) and take advantage of inheritance to minimize code volume.",x,,,,1,4,4,
"TASK 2: Obstacle course includes at least one rotating object, and at least one ball is launched into the scene. It will be helpful if you explain in your writeup which file contains your obstacle course and how it should be run.",x,,,,1,4,4,
TASK 3: User interaction has been incorporated into a scene using keyboard and/or mouse feedback from the user. Your interactive elements must be explained in the writeup and the file header so that your grader understands how to play the game!  Happy Thanksgiving!!!,x,,,,1,4,4,
On the house: These points are on the house. Great work completing the project!,x,,,,1,1,1,

"Creativity: Extension tackles a new and interesting design challenge. Examples include (but are not limited to!) using CS to solve a problem in another course, modeling something in the real world that interests you, creating a game, or exploring a CS principle we haven't yet talked about in class.",,x,,,0.5,3,1.5,
Efficiency: Extension demonstrates computational thinking by solving your chosen problem in as few lines of code and with as few computational operations as possible (without sacrificing readability).,,x,,,0.5,1,0.5,
