CS152 Project 05 Rubric,,,,,,,,
"Grading: A project grade of 29 or 30 is a mark of honor, not given lightly. Recieving 1-3 extension points means that you earned 1-3 points on top of your core project. It does not mean that you lost 1 or more points. Celebrate your successes, and use the extension as an opportunity to explore a design challenge that interests you.",,,,,,,,
"Instructions for graders: To use this rubric, place an ""x"" in the appropriate column to indicate whether criteria are strongly satisfied, partially satisfied, or absent. Unmarked rows default to absent.",,,,,,,,
"Writeup Criteria
Writeups should be about 1 page long + images.",Strong,Developing,Emerging,Insufficient,Coeff,Max Pts Possible,Pts Earned,Comments
"Abstract defines this project's key lecture concepts for a general, non-CS audience. This week's key lecture topic is multidimensional lists. ",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Abstract summarizes program's context and output,in 1-2 sentences, highlighting a couple of important algorithmic and/or scientific details. What does your program do? What should the user expect to see when they run your program?",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Results are clearly presented in human-friendly images (e.g. graphs), labeled with captions, and concisely but clearly interpreted for a general audience (who have not taken this course) in the text. If your output includes numbers, explain for a general audience what these numbers mean!",x,,,,1,1.5,1.5,
Reflection (in a brief paragraph) draws connections between lecture concepts utilized in this project and real-world problems that interest you. How else could these concepts apply to our everyday lives? ,x,,,,1,0.25,0.25,
Follow-up answers are correct and in your own words.,x,,,,1,0.25,0.25,
"Acknowledgements: Sources, imported libraries, tutorials, and collaborators are cited, or a note is included indicating that none were referenced.",x,,,,1,1,1,This was a very good report with excellent explanations of the results.

"File header at the top of every file includes your name, the date, a description of the file's purpose, and instructions on how to run the project from the Terminal.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Docstrings are present in every function. Each docstring describes the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value (if any).",x,,,,1,2,2,
"Comments explain key design and implementation decisions, e.g. complex equations and blocks of code. For example, please label each version of your sum and average calculations.",x,,,,1,1,1,
Code organization: Code is organized into functions with no significant top-level code. The program's first algorithmic step is a call to the main() function.,x,,,,1,1,1,
"Variable and function names are brief but descriptive, helping others understand their purpose.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"LAB TASKS 1-3:  elephant.py contains correct and efficient functions for elephant creation and aging: newElephant(), initPopulation(), incrementAge().",x,,,,1,4,4,
"TASKS 1-8:  elephant.py contains correct and efficient functions for both population control strategies: calcSurvival(), dartElephants(), cullElephants(), controlPopulation(), simulateMonth(), simulateYear(), calcResults(), runSimulation().",x,,,,1,8,8,
"TASK 9: main() accepts the probability of darting as a command line parameter, initializes the parameters list, runs a simulation, and prints the helpfully labeled results to the terminal.",x,,,,1,3,3,

"Creativity: Extension tackles a new and interesting design challenge. Examples include (but are not limited to!) using CS to solve a problem in another course, modeling something in the real world that interests you, creating a game, or exploring a CS principle we haven't yet talked about in class.",,x,,,0.5,3,1.5,
Efficiency: Extension demonstrates computational thinking by solving your chosen problem in as few lines of code and with as few computational operations as possible (without sacrificing readability).,,x,,,0.5,1,0.5,
