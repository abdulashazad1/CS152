CS152 Project 04 Rubric,,,,,,,,
"Grading: A project grade of 29 or 30 is a mark of honor, not given lightly. Recieving 1-3 extension points means that you earned 1-3 points on top of your core project. It does not mean that you lost 1 or more points. Celebrate your successes, and use the extension as an opportunity to explore a design challenge that interests you.",,,,,,,,
"On the house: A few points are ""on the house,""  meaning that they are earned in full by every completed project. The score entry boxes for these points are grayed out in the rubric.",,,,,,,,
"Instructions for graders: To use this rubric, place an ""x"" in the appropriate column to indicate whether criteria are strongly satisfied, partially satisfied, or absent. Unmarked rows default to absent.",,,,,,,,

"Abstract defines this project's key lecture concepts for a general, non-CS audience. This week's key lecture topic is lists. ",,x,,,0.8,0.75,0.6,Missing list definitions
"Abstract describes program's context and output, highlighting a couple of important algorithmic and/or scientific details. What does your program do? What should the user expect to see when they run your program?",x,,,,1,0.25,0.25,
"Results: Solutions to tasks: Summarize key design and implementation decisions in your own words, focusing on part(s) of the project that most interested you and/or that required you to debug a tricky solution. This can often be done in 2-3 paragraphs if you're writing very clearly and to the point, but use your judgement.",,,x,,0.6,0.75,0.45,Very simply explain your design process.
"Results: All included images/outputs are present, labeled with captions, and explained in the text. For full credit, you must explain every output value and plot for the reader, including its units and what this value/plot says about the world!",,x,,,0.8,1,0.8,Could use a little more detail explaining the simulations.
Reflection: Follow up questions are answered in your own words and numbered in the rest of the results section.,x,,,,1,0.5,0.5,
Reflection addresses how the lecture concepts from the abstract made this project achievable and how they apply to our everyday lives. For example: How many more lines of code this project would have taken without these tools? What other kinds of problems could you solve with these tools? Is there a connection between this project and a familiar tool you've used outside of class?,x,,,,1,0.5,0.5,"Should be about lists too, but good defining other extra lecture concepts."

"File header at the top of every file includes your name, the date, a description of the file's purpose, and instructions for how to run the project from the Terminal.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"Docstrings are present in every function. Each docstring describes the function's purpose, its parameters, and its return value (if any).",x,,,,1,2,2,
"Comments explain key design and implementation decisions, e.g. complex equations and blocks of code. For example, what does your if-elif-else test for, and why? What does your loop iterate over, and why?",x,,,,1,1,1,
Code organization: Code is organized into functions with no significant top-level code. The program's first algorithmic step is a call to the main() function. Library functions are imported rather than rewritten in the main file.,x,,,,1,1,1,
"Variable and function names are brief but descriptive, helping others understand the purpose of each variable.",x,,,,1,1,1,
"TASKS 2-8:  penguin.py contains correct and efficient functions for initPopulation(), simulateYear(), runSimulation(), and computeCEPD().",x,,,,1,5,5,
TASK 6:  main() accepts command line arguments (argv) for the number of simulations to run and the number of years between El Nino events. ,x,,,,1,2,2,
"TASK 6:  main() runs multiple simulations, aggregating the results in a list. This list is passed to computeCEPD() for processing.",x,,,,1,2,2,
"TASK 8: Plot of the CEPD is included in your writeup, visualizing your CEPD results for three runs of 1000 simulations for 201 years with the default parameters",x,,,,1,1,1,
"TASK 9: Analysis (with plot). The writeup includes an analysis of CEPD with respect to the number of years between El Nino events. This analysis is accompanied by a visualization (plot) of your CEPD results for the three El Nino cycle options. 
No simulation -- no matter how well implemented -- is worth the time you put into it unless its findings are interpreted for the general public. Beyond stating the CEPD values for 3-, 5-, and 7-year El Nino cycles, this analysis explains for the reader what these numbers tell us about the relationship between El Nino frequency and the penguin's survival as a species.",,x,,,0.8,2,1.6,

"Creativity: Extension tackles a new and interesting design challenge. Examples include (but are not limited to!) using CS to solve a problem in another course, modeling something in the real world that interests you, creating a game, or exploring a CS principle we haven't yet talked about in class.",,,x,,0.25,3,0.75,
Efficiency: Extension demonstrates computational thinking by solving your chosen problem in as few lines of code and with as few computational operations as possible (without sacrificing readability).,,x,,,0.5,1,0.5,
